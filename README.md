# isye-6644-tausworthe
Includes the scripts and paper for my course project in Georgia Tech's ISYE 6644 - Simulation.

This project has few dependencies, but for the sake of completeness I've used pipenv to manage them. In order to ensure you've got
the right stuff installed to run the code:
  - install pipenv on your machine (see 'https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/' for details)
  - type 'pipenv install' in the command line from within the project directory
